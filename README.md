# Safety-Analysis-of-Unmanned-Autonomous-Vehicles

Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies are being integrated into many activities that we take for granted. For example, the continued development and commercial deployment of unmanned vehicles promise a global revolution in transportation infrastructure. 

In this project, we will investigate one type of unmanned vehicle: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) running on the road. Specifically, we will first learn to generate data with different scenarios and different driving conditions from an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, Carla. By analyzing the simulated driving data, we will derive insights into the AVâ€™s safety and common causes of failure. Then we will apply our analysis to a real dataset from the California DMV to make more practical conclusions. Such insights are instrumental in developing more reliable unmanned vehicles and reducing the chance of accidents.

In this project, we will study the simulated & real-world data of AVs using fundamental concepts from probability and statistics. The concepts you will learn and apply include the following:

1. Parsing and visualizing datasets (Importing, extracting, and summarizing features)

2. Basic statistical analysis of dataset

3. Probabilistic analysis of the data using concepts from ECE 313 (e.g., Probability,
Conditional Probability, Total Probability)

4. Using Bayesian inference to derive posterior probabilities

5. Develop and perform statistical inference with a Bayesian Network
